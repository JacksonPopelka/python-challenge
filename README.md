Module 3

Hello! In Module 3 I worked on 2 seperate files that you will see under folders "PyBank" and "PyPoll". 

The first one I worked on was a python file called "main.py" in the folder "PyBank". In this python file we are analyzing the csv file "budget_data.csv" from the "Resources" folder in which we are trying to find the total number of months included in the dataset,  and the net total amount of profit/loss over the entire period. We will also be finding the changes in profit/loss over the entire period and the average of those numbers along with the greatest increase and decrease in profits for the entire period as well. Towards the end of the code in line 63 we will use this to print the results that we gathered using the code above! These results were then exported to a text file in the "analysis" folder.  

The second one I worked on was also a python file but this time in the "PyPoll" folder also named "main.py". But this time we will be analyzing election results where we will analyze the poll results and pull data like total votes cast (which will help us find those percentages later), a list of each of the candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won (this is why we needed the total votes and not just how many each candidate got), the total number of votes each candidate got, and finally we need the winner of the election based on the popular vote of course (this is because some elections have an electoral college format which we do not have access to that information but thats besides the point). Lastly same as above we will then print the results, and also output them to a text file which is "election_analysis" in the "analysis" folder!

I hope you enjoyed reading about this module and it was a bit more interesting than just reading boring old code and better luck next time raymon anthony doane (only 3.139% votes)
